  rules:
    Follow Elysium's Community Documents: >
      Everyone is expected to read and abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ElysiumMods/Community/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md)
      and QuiltMC's [NSFW Content Policy](https://quiltmc.org/community/nsfw-policy/)

    Follow Discord's rules: >
      As a Discord-based community, we require everyone to follow Discord's
      [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) and [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms)

    Try to speak English: >
      The common language in our community is English, but we understand that not everyone speaks English at the same
      level. Try to speak English to the best of your ability, and don't worry if you need to use translation tools. We
      will not tolerate making fun of people for poor English.

    Listen to & respect all community team members: >
      Please take requests from community team members seriously and listen when a team member asks you to do
      something. If you have a problem with what a team member is asking you to do, we advise that you step away from
      the situation and send a private message to another team member.

    Keep all projects legal, legitimate & appropriate: >
      We will not tolerate any projects that may break laws, breach a Terms of Service or an EULA, involve sexual
      content, or that the moderators determine to be malicious or inappropriate.

    Donâ€™t spam: >
      Don't spam our channels or users, and don't advertise your projects outside of the relevant showcase channels.

    Respect our channels: >
      Follow the given channel topic, and don't derail a discussion
    
    Don't ask for help with EnderIO: >
      This mod is not EnderIO, rather a port of it. Please go to their means of support for issues with it, as we will not provide support for EnderIO here.

    Don't import drama or controversy from other communities: >
      One of our most important rules - don't make things difficult for other users by bringing up controversies from
      other communities.
    
    Before asking 'Why is the bot talking': >
      It is not a bot, rather PluralKit/ProxyFox. This is used to have greater accessibility for plural systems. See [QuiltMC's docs on this topic](https://quiltmc.org/community/pluralkit/)

    - title: Subjects to Avoid
      color: 0x6C0000

      description: >
        Sometimes, something begins trending or becoming popular, or an event happens in the community. We try to
        allow for discussions to happen, but that isn't always possible. For that reason, we ask that you **do not post
        or talk about the following things:**


        **Â»** AI-generated "body horror" images - generated images of people, animals or faces that are disfigured or
        look "wrong" in any way.


        **Â»** Anything relating to Mojang's new Java Edition chat reporting features, including discussions relating to
        potential exploits, or mods that make use of them. As an exception to this rule, you may discuss strategies
        and mods for mitigating the usage of exploits on your servers, and good-faith mods that allow you to control
        how chat reporting works on your servers.


        This list will change over time, and we're equally likely to add or remove things as the way people approach
        these subjects online changes.

      description: >
        Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the Quilt Moderation Team
        by privately messaging the <@1072630731056107591> ModMail bot. This will open a private channel between you
        and the Moderators.

        You can also right-click (or long-tap on mobile) a message and select Apps > Report to quickly forward
        that message to the Moderators. The bot will prompt you to add more comments if you would like to.
