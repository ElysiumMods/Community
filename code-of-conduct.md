# Code of Conduct

Elysium bases it's rules and policies around a Code of Conduct. It provides
behavioural expectations for every member within the Elysium community.
**Not reading the Code of Conduct is NOT an excuse for breaking it.**

The Code of Conduct is the basis for our Discord server rules.

## Our Pledge

We as community members, contributors, and team members pledge to make
participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, culture, ethnicity, gender identity & expression, nationality,
physical or mental disabilities or differences (regardless of intensity),
politics, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, socio-economic status or
subcultural affiliation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community, and we are committed to promoting
these concepts.

## Our Standards

We expect the members of our community to participate in a positive, authentic
and deliberate way. Consideration, respect and empathy are key when it comes to
building and supporting a healthy community and we request that all members of
the Elysium community exercise this throughout all of their actions

Examples of behaviour that contribute to a positive, comfortable environment for
our community include (but are not limited to):

* Demonstrating empathy, patience and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Respecting others’ personal choices, even when they don’t line up with yours
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and
  learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include (but are not limited to):

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
 any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments
* Personal or political attacks
* Threats of violence, or violent acts towards others
* Public or private harassment
* Intentionally dead-naming or misgendering others
* Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address,
without their explicit permission (“doxxing”)
* Gatekeeping others’ access to mental health or accessibility tools
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any unacceptable forms of behavior
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Enforcement Responsibilites

Community team members are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards
of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

If a community member engages in behavior violating this Code of Conduct, the
members of the community team may take any action they deem appropriate. Actions
may range from a simple warning to the most drastic: permanent removal from the
community, exclusion from any interaction, and loss of all rights in the community.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces (both online and offline),
as well as when an individual is officially representing the community in public
spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct applies to all projects, repositories and community spaces
that are managed by Elysium, regardless of whether or not the use of this code
is explicitly called out. We also reserve the right to retroactively enforce this
Code of Conduct when community members violate it in spaces not managed by Elysium.

### Reporting a problem

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported
to the Elysium moderators directly on Discord, either via private message or the
ModMail (ModMail#7463) bot. If your report concerns a moderator or group of moderators,
please send your report to a team member that is not part of the report.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly, and all team
members are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any
incident.

## Changes & Feedback

It is likely that this Code of Conduct will need additions, modifications and other
improvements. Online culture changes, new views and sensitivities emerge which
need to be taken into account. To that end, we reserve the right to update this
Code of Conduct at any time, pending feedback from the community when possible.

We always welcome feedback and suggestions. If you’d like to provide either, feel
free to open an issue on GitHub!
